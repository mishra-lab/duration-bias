\paragraph{Data \& Crude Estimate}
The survey in \cite{Baral2014} did not ask respondents about duration selling sex directly,
only about current age and age of first selling sex.
The difference between these ages could be used to estimate duration selling sex.
Using this approach, the raw median duration was $\hat{d} = 4$ years.
However, if durations are exponentially distributed
--- an implicit assumption in compartmental models \cite{Anderson1991} ---
then the mean $\bar{d}$ is related to the the median by
$\bar{d} = \hat{d}/\distr{log}{2}$ due to skewness.

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{Sampling}
The crude estimate above does not consider sampling bias.
However, sampling bias was considered via RDS-adjustment in \cite{Baral2014},
yielding mean and \ci estimates of the proportions of respondents $p_z$
who had sold sex starting $\mathbb{d}_z \in \{0{-}2, 3{-}5, 6{-}10, 11+\}$ years ago
(Table~\ref{tab:data}, ``$z$'' enumerates strata).
Discarding the crude estimate above,
we restart our estimation by defining a model to identify
distributions of reported durations selling sex $d_i$
which are consistent with these RDS-adjusted data.
We model each proportion $p_z$ as a random variable with
a beta approximation of binomial (BAB) distribution (see Appendix~\ref{app.bab})
with parameters $N_z$ and $\rho_z$.
We model each $N_z$ as a fixed value,
which we fit to the \ci of $p_z$ as described in \sref{app.bab}.
We then model each $\rho_z$ as
the proportion of reported durations $d_i$ within the interval $\mathbb{d}_z$.
Since these proportions are difficult to define analytically,
we estimate $\hat{\rho}_z = \distr{mean}{d_i \in \mathbb{d}_z}$
from $N = 100$ samples --- \ie $100$ simulated respondents.
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{Censoring}
These reported durations $d_i$ are effectively right censored
because they only capture engagement in sex work up until the survey,
and not additional sex work after the survey
(Figure~\ref{fig:diag.yss.censor}) \cite{Fazito2012}.
If we assume that the survey reaches respondents at a random time point
during their total (eventual) duration selling sex $D_i$
--- \ie censoring is uniform --- we can model this censoring via
a random fraction $f_i \sim \distr{Unif}{0,1}$, such that $d_i = f_i D_i$;
the expected means are then related by $\bar{d} / \bar{D} = \bar{f} = \frac12$ \cite{Tufto2017}.
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{Interruption}
Finally, respondents may not sell sex continuously.
Reported durations $d_i$ may therefore include
multiple periods of selling sex with gaps in between,
whereas we aim to model $D_i$ as the durations of individual periods selling sex.
Respondents in \cite{Baral2014} were not asked whether they ever temporarily stopped selling sex,
but a later survey \cite{EswKP2014} indicated that $\phi = 45\%$ had stopped at least once.
We model the number of times a respondent may temporarily stop selling sex as
a Poisson-distributed random variable $s_i$ with mean~$\bar{s}$.
The expected value of $\phi$ given $\bar{s}$ is then $\distr{P}{s > 0} = 1 - e^{-\bar{s}}$.
Since $\phi = 45\%$ is an imperfect observation,
we model $\phi$ as a random variable with a BAB distribution
having parameters $N = 328$ and $\rho = 1 - e^{-\bar{s}}$,
which allows inference on the rate $\bar{s}$ given $\phi$.
\par
Next, we update the model for reported durations as $d_i = D_i\,(f_i + s_i\,(1 + g_i))$,
where $g_i$ is the relative duration of gaps between selling sex,
with the following rationale.
If $s_i = 0$, then $d_i = f_i D_i$ as before, reflecting the censored current period only.
If $s_i > 0$, then $d_i$ also includes $s_i$ prior periods selling sex and the gaps between them
(Figure~\ref{fig:diag.yss.gaps}) --- \ie $s_i\,(D_i + g_i D_i) = D_i\,s_i\,(1 + g_i)$.
The major assumption we make here is that
all successive periods are of equal length, and likewise for gaps between them.
We must also assume a distribution for $g_i$, for which we choose
$g_i \sim \distr{Exp}{1/\bar{g}}$, arbitrarily.

\paragraph{Summary}
Figure~\ref{fig:model.yss} summarizes the proposed model graphically.
The primary parameter of interest is
the mean duration selling sex (for a given period) $\bar{D}$,
but we must also infer
the mean number of times respondents stop selling sex $\bar{s}$, and
the mean relative duration of gaps $\bar{g}$.
We assume uninformative priors for these 3 parameters.
