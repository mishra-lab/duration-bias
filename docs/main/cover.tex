Dear Dr. Geretti,
\par
We are pleased to submit the attached manuscript entitled
\emph{Duration considerations for cross-sectional estimates of sexual behaviour:
  developing bias adjustments using Bayesian hierarchical models}
for consideration as an \emph{Original Article} in \emph{Sexually Transmitted Infections}.
\par
Quantitative estimates of sexual behaviour are required
as inputs to mathematical models of sexually transmitted infections,
and in other studies of sexually transmitted infection epidemiology.
Such estimates are often derived from cross-sectional surveys.
While previous work has explored established biases associated with survey-based estimates
(\eg recall bias, reporting bias),
less attention has been paid to measurement error, such as estimate-estimand mismatch
(\eg numbers of partners in the past 30 days \vs partnership change rate).
\par
In this study, we explore precise interpretation of survey data to inform two key parameters:
durations in epidemiological risk states (\eg selling sex) and
rates of sexual partnership change (\eg casual partners per year).
We identify potential sources of bias,
and develop Bayesian hierarchical models to reflect
mechanistic assumptions about the bias-generating processes.
Fitting these models to aggregate data from
a previously published study of female sex workers in Eswatini,
we show that failure to account for particular biases can
substantially influence estimates of both parameters explored.
\par
While we focus on these two key parameters,
we expect that our approach and findings would be relevant to
other estimates of sexual behaviour from cross-sectional surveys,
and thus of interest to the broad readership of \emph{Sexually Transmitted Infections}.
\par
Thank you for your consideration and we look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerly,
