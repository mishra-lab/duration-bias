Dear Dr. Jenness,
\par
We are pleased to submit the attached manuscript entitled
\emph{Adjusting for duration biases in sexual behaviour data}
for consideration as a \emph{Validation} study in \emph{Epidemiology}.
\par
Quantitative estimates of sexual behaviour are required
as inputs to mathematical models of STI transmission and in other studies of STI epidemiology.
Such estimates are often derived from cross-sectional surveys.
While previous work has explored potential biases associated with survey-based estimates
(\eg rounding error, recall bias, reporting bias),
less attention has been paid to biases associated with estimate-estimand mismatch
(\eg numbers of partners in the past 30 days \vs partnership change rate).
\par
In this study, we explore precise interpretation of survey data to inform two key variables:
durations in epidemiological risk groups (\eg female sex workers) and
rates of sexual partnership change.
We identify potential sources of bias,
and develop Bayesian hierarchical models to reflect
mechanistic assumptions about the bias-generating processes.
Fitting these models to aggregate data from
a previously published study of female sex workers in Eswatini,
we show that failure to account for particular biases can
substantially influence estimates of both variables explored.
\par
While we focus on sexual behavior data,
we expect that our approach and findings would be relevant to
other estimates of intermittent risk exposure and event rates from cross-sectional surveys,
and thus of interest to the broad readership of \emph{Epidemiology}.
\par
Thank you for your consideration and we look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerly,
