\section{Introduction}
Mathematical models of sexually transmitted infections require
estimates of sexual behaviour for model inputs (parameters) \cite{Garnett2002}.
In risk-stratified models, two important parameters are:
the duration of time within epidemiological risk states/groups, and
rates of sexual partnership change for each group
\cite{Garnett1996,Stigum1997,Watts2010,Knight2020}.
For example, the average duration of time selling sex can be used to define
the modelled rate of ``turnover'' among sex workers \cite{Knight2020},
while, numbers of main, casual, and/or paying sexual partners per year
can be used to define the modelled ``force of infection'' \cite{Boily2015}.
\par
Data to inform these parameters largely come from cross-sectional studies,
and are often only available as aggregate estimates (\vs individual-level data).
While much attention has been paid to
sampling and reporting biases affecting sexual behaviour data \cite{Fenton2001},
relatively less work has examined censoring biases.
Our aim is therefore to described and address
several types of censoring biases when estimating:
(1) duration selling sex, and (2) rates of partnership change,
from aggregate cross-sectional estimates.
We use data from a 2011 female sex worker survey in Eswatini \cite{Yam2013}
to support parameterization of an HIV transmission model.
