\section{Introduction}
Quantifying sexual behaviour
is necessary to study the epidemiology of sexually transmitted infections (STI),
including to inform inputs for STI transmission modelling \cite{Fenton2001}.
Two important quantities are:
the duration of time within a ``risk group'' such as sex workers (for a given definition)
\cite{?}, and
the rate of new partnership formation, possibly stratified by partnership type
\cite{?}.
\par
Our aims are to motivate and discuss bias adjuments for estimating:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item duration within sex work
  \item rate of partnership change
\end{enumerate}
from cross-sectional survey data,
considering issues of sampling bias and censoring.
