\section{Introduction}
Quantifying sexual behaviour
is necessary to study the epidemiology of sexually transmitted infections (STI),
including to inform inputs for STI transmission modelling \cite{Fenton2001}.
Two important quantities for STI transmission modelling are:
the duration of time within a ``risk group'' such as female sex workers (FSW), and
the rate of partnership formation, possibly stratified by partnership type
\cite{Garnett1996,Stigum1997,Henry2015,Knight2020}.
However, often only crude aggregate estimates of these quantities are available
from previously published studies (\vs individual-level data).
Such estimates may be biased due to distribution, sampling, censoring, and measurement issues.
\par
Our aim is therefore to motivate and develop bias adjuments for estimating:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item duration in a risk group
  \item rate of partnership change
\end{enumerate}
from cross-sectional survey data, considering these issues.
We explore these topics using aggregate estimates from
a 2011 FSW survey in Eswatini~\cite{Baral2014}.
