\paragraph{Base Data \& Assumptions}
% LW: i wonder if helpful to break ur base estimate/data into two sections:
%     one section focus on describing the survey data only.
%     2nd section focus on 'conventional ways of estimating the paramters of interest
%     from the survey data' (aka: base estimate).
%     same applies fro the 2.1
The survey \cite{Baral2014} also asked respondents to report
their numbers of sexual partners ($x$) in a recall period ($\omega$) of $30$ days.
Numbers were stratified by three types of partner:
new paying clients, regular paying clients, and non-paying partners.
% LW: add here: 'however, the survey did not ask about duration for each type of partnerhship"
%     u had below - i think better bring up here.
%     describe what is survey data is available/ and what is not (limitation). then ur solutions.
%     i would consider bring in the word 'triangulation' some where in your paper.
%     it is not just biases adjustment - if the data collected was not intended to use for
%     a specific estimates. but rather missing data problem in certain case.
We assume that only a small proportion of new clients go on to become regular clients;
thus, we conceptualize ``new'' clients as effectively ``one-off'' clients.%
\footnote{The number of new clients per recall period
  could also be used to define a rate of partnership change \cite{Fazito2012},
  but we do not explore this approach here.}
Since no survey questions asked about partnership durations ($\delta$),
we further assume that these were:
1~day with new paying clients,
4~months with regular paying clients, and
3~years with non-paying partners.
We now develop the hierarchical model to estimate
the expected rate of partnership change for each type,
considering the following potential biases.
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{Sampling}
As before, \cite{Baral2014} estimates RDS-adjusted proportions of respondents $p_z$ (mean, \ci)
reporting different numbers/ranges of partners $\mathbb{x}_z$ in the past 30 days
(Table~\ref{tab:data}).
Thus, we take the same approach as in \sref{meth.yss}
to identify distributions of reported partner numbers $x_i$
which are consistent with these proportion data for each partnership type.
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{Duration Assumptions}
Numbers of reported partners ($x$) have generally been interpreted in two ways ---
$x/\omega$ as the \emph{rate} of partnership change ($Q$) or
$x$ as the \emph{number} of current partners ($K$):
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:bQK}
\begin{alignat}{1}
  Q &\approx \frac{x}{\omega} \label{eq:bQ}\\
    &\text{or} \nonumber\\
  K &\approx x \label{eq:bK}
\end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
Both interpretations are reasonable under certain conditions:
If partnership duration is short and the recall period is long
($\delta \ll \omega$, \eg 1~day \vs 1~month),
then reported partnerships mostly reflect \emph{complete} partnerships,
and thus $x/\omega \approx Q$.
If partnership duration is long and the recall period is short
($\delta \gg \omega$, \eg 1~year \vs 1~month),
then reported partnerships mostly reflect \emph{ongoing} partnerships,
and thus $x \approx K$.
However, if partnership duration and recall period are similar in length
($\delta \approx \omega$, \eg 1~month \vs 1~month),
then reported partnerships reflect a mixture of tail-ends, of complete, and of ongoing partnerships.
Thus $x/\omega$ overestimates $Q$, but $x$ also overestimates $K$.
These three cases are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:diag.partner.cases}.
\par
To adjust for this bias, we again assume that survey/recall period timing is effectively random.
Then, if the \emph{end} of the recall period would intersect an ongoing partnership,
then a random fraction $f_i \sim \distr{Unif}{0,1}$ of the partnership duration $\delta$
would be outside the recall period.
As before, the expected value $\bar{f} = \frac12$.
% LW: for this part - (same goes for the previous section) -
%     i wonder if other modeling studies have incorporated the same in their parameterization?
%     if so - could cite and mention.
The same goes for the \emph{start} of the recall period.
Thus, the recall period is effectively extended by
half the partnership duration $\delta/2$ on each end, and $\delta$ overall \cite{Neely2023},
as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:diag.partner.recall}.
We can therefore define unbiased estimators of $Q$ and $K$ as:
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:uQK}
\begin{alignat}{1}
  Q &= \frac{x}{\omega + \delta}\\
  K &= \frac{x \delta}{\omega + \delta} = Q \delta
\end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
To apply \eqref{eq:uQK} in the hierarchical model, we sample the true rate of partnership change
from an assumed distribution $Q_i \sim \distr{Gamma}{\alpha,\beta}$,
with unknown parameters $\alpha, \beta$.
Then, we model the numbers of reported partners $x_i$
given $Q_i$ and $\omega' = (\omega + \delta)$ as: $x_i \sim \distr{Poi}{Q\,\omega'}$.
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{Summary}
Figure~\ref{fig:model.part} summarizes the proposed model graphically.
The primary parameters of interest are $\alpha, \beta$, which govern
the distribution of rates of partnership change (for a given type) $Q$.
We assume uninformative priors for these 2 parameters.
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{Comparing Assumptions}
To quantify the influence of using
the biased \vs unbiased estimators of $Q$ and $K$,
% LW: shall we call it crude vs. adjusted estimates instead?
%     (for estimates when u adjust for partial bias mechanism - what do u call it for now?)
we fit the proposed model for each partnership type under three assumptions:
assuming \emph{short} partnerships as in \eqref{eq:bQ} with $\omega' = \omega$;
assuming \emph{long} partnerships as in \eqref{eq:bK} with $\omega' = \delta$; and
our \emph{unbiased} approach as in \eqref{eq:uQK} with $\omega' = \omega + \delta$.
% LW: i wonder instead calling as 3 assumptions - the 3rd one is not really an assumption
%     but ur proposed bias adjusted approach - which can handle any assumption
%     of partnership duration estimates. wonder if u can make it clearer.
To illustrate more general trends in the magnitude of bias,
we further compared biased \vs unbiased estimates of $Q$ and $K$ across a range of different
partnership durations $\delta \in [0.1, 10]$ and
recall periods $\omega \in [0.1, 10]$,
with fixed true rate $Q = 1$ (arbitrary units).
