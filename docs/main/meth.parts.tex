\paragraph{Data \& Assumptions}
The survey \cite{Baral2014} also asked respondents to report
their numbers of sexual partners in a recall period of 30 days.
Numbers were stratified by three types of partner:
new paying clients, regular paying clients, and non-paying partners.
However, the survey did not ask about partnership durations.
We assume that only a small proportion of new clients go on to become regular clients;
thus, we conceptualize ``new'' clients as effectively ``one-off'' clients.%
\footnote{The number of new clients per recall period
  could also be used to define a rate of partnership change \cite{Fazito2012},
  but we do not explore this approach here.}
We further assume that partnership durations were:
1~day with new paying clients,
4~months with regular paying clients, and
3~years with non-paying partners.
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{Crude Estimates}
Numbers of reported partners ($x$) in a given recall period ($\omega$)
have generally been interpreted in two ways ---
$x/\omega$ as the \emph{rate} of partnership change ($Q$) or
$x$ as the \emph{number} of current partners ($K$):
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:bQK}
\begin{alignat}{1}
  Q &\approx \frac{x}{\omega} \label{eq:bQ}\\
    &\text{or} \nonumber\\
  K &\approx x \label{eq:bK}
\end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
Both interpretations are reasonable under certain conditions.
If partnership duration is short and the recall period is long
($\delta \ll \omega$, \eg 1~day \vs 1~month),
then reported partnerships mostly reflect \emph{complete} partnerships,
and thus $x/\omega \approx Q$.
If partnership duration is long and the recall period is short
($\delta \gg \omega$, \eg 1~year \vs 1~month),
then reported partnerships mostly reflect \emph{ongoing} partnerships,
and thus $x \approx K$.
However, if partnership duration and recall period are similar in length
($\delta \approx \omega$, \eg 1~month \vs 1~month),
then reported partnerships reflect a mixture of tail-ends, of complete, and of ongoing partnerships.
Thus $x/\omega$ overestimates $Q$, but $x$ also overestimates $K$.
These three cases are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:diag.partner.cases}.
To move beyond these crude estimates of $Q$ and $K$,
we develop the another hierarchical model as follows.
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{Sampling}
As before, \cite{Baral2014} estimates RDS-adjusted proportions of respondents $p_z$ (mean, \ci)
reporting different numbers/ranges of partners $\mathbb{x}_z$ in the past 30 days
(Table~\ref{tab:data}).
Thus, we take the same approach as in \sref{meth.yss}
to identify distributions of reported partner numbers $x_i$
which are consistent with these proportion data for each partnership type.
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{Censoring}
To account for reporting of tail-ends, complete, and ongoing partnerships within the recall period,
we again assume that survey/recall period timing is effectively random.
Then, if the start of the recall period would intersect an ongoing partnership,
then a random fraction $f_i \sim \distr{Unif}{0,1}$ of the partnership duration $\delta$
would be outside the recall period.
As before, the expected value $\bar{f} = \frac12$.
The same goes for the end of the recall period.
Thus, the recall period is effectively extended by
half the partnership duration $\delta/2$ on each end, and $\delta$ overall \cite{Neely2023},
as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:diag.partner.recall}.
We can therefore define unbiased estimators of $Q$ and $K$ as:
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:uQK}
\begin{alignat}{1}
  Q &= \frac{x}{\omega + \delta}\\
  K &= \frac{x \delta}{\omega + \delta} = Q \delta
\end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
To apply \eqref{eq:uQK} in the hierarchical model, we sample the true rate of partnership change
from an assumed distribution $Q_i \sim \distr{Gamma}{\alpha,\beta}$,
with unknown parameters $\alpha, \beta$.
Then, we model the numbers of reported partners $x_i$
given $Q_i$ and $\omega' = (\omega + \delta)$ as: $x_i \sim \distr{Poi}{Q\,\omega'}$.
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{Summary}
Figure~\ref{fig:model.part} summarizes the proposed model graphically.
The primary parameters of interest are $\alpha, \beta$, which govern
the distribution of rates of partnership change (for a given type) $Q$.
We assume uninformative priors for these 2 parameters.
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{Comparing Approaches}
To quantify the influence of using
the crude \vs adjusted estimators of $Q$~and~$K$,
we fit the proposed model for each partnership type under three approaches:
crude assuming \emph{short} partnerships as in \eqref{eq:bQ} with $\omega' = \omega$;
crude assuming \emph{long} partnerships as in \eqref{eq:bK} with $\omega' = \delta$; and
our \emph{adjusted} approach as in \eqref{eq:uQK} with $\omega' = \omega + \delta$.
To illustrate more general trends in the magnitude of potential biases,
we further compared crude \vs adjusted estimates of $Q$ and $K$ across a range of different
partnership durations $\delta \in [0.1, 10]$ and
recall periods $\omega \in [0.1, 10]$,
with fixed true rate $Q = 1$ (arbitrary units).
