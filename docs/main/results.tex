\subsection{Risk Group Duration}\label{res.yss}
Figure~\ref{fig:yss.fit} illustrates the distributions of
observed proportions $p_z$ \vs inferred proportions $\hat{\rho}_z$ of women  %SM: stylistic question - shall we refer to as individuals instead of women? feels like individuals makes the motivating example less about a gendered element per se? [esp in epi/empirical research when we tend to refer to individuals or participants, etc.? -  just a thought that came up as i was reading again...
reporting durations $d_i \in \mathbb{d}_z$ selling sex,
following each stage of adjustment outlined in \sref{meth.yss}.
Figure~\ref{fig:yss.adj} illustrates
the estimated cumulative distributions for years selling sex following each stage of adjustment,
while Table~\ref{tab:yss.adj} provides the corresponding distribution means $\bar{D}$ and \ci.
In this case, the final estimate of 4.06~(2.29,~6.34) is similar to the original median of 4,  %SM: why "ironically" - we don't explain the irony and leaves to reader to interpret this phrasing [thinking of readers for whom English may not be first language too - i've often got feedack like this lol, so mayne say "in this case" if that is what we mean?
because each adjustment alternates betwen increasing and decreasing $\bar{D}$.  %SM: BMJ editor's tip to me that i'll pass on :) ... to use "because" instead of "as" re: clarity in linking the cause-effect logic...
The censoring adjustment yields the largest increase, while
the measurement adjustment yields the largest decrease.

\subsection{Rates of Partnership Change}\label{res.parts}
Figure~\ref{fig:parts.fit} illustrates the distributions of
observed proportions $p_z$ \vs inferred proportions $\hat{\rho}_z$ of women
reporting $x_i \in \mathbb{x}_z$ partners in the past 30 days,
under the three partnership duration assumptions.
Figure~\ref{fig:parts.fsw} illustrates the inferred  %SM: nice figure
rates of partnership change ($Q$) and numbers of current partners ($K$) under each assumption,
while Table~\ref{tab:parts.fsw} provides the corresponding means and \ci.
The biased estimates of $Q$ and $K$ appear equal because $Q$ is defined as per-month. %SM: well explained
Biases are strongest for %SM: not sure "strongest" is best term. perhaps more influential? or largest? (the term "strongest" sounds somewhat less precise than the other terms re: what we mean?). largest and substantial (used below) seem more logical re: theme of quantifying influence?
$Q$ with long partnerships (\eg non-paying partners) and
$K$ with short partnership (\eg new clients).
However, biases are also substantial for  %SM: here, we refer to "quantity" when we talk about the size of influence of bias mechanism.
both $Q$ and $K$ with ``medium-length'' partnerships (\eg regular clients).
Figure~\ref{fig:parts.grid} illustrates generalized trends in these biases.
