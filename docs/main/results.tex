\subsection{Risk Group Duration}\label{res.yss}
Figure~\ref{fig:yss.fit} illustrates the distributions of
observed proportions $p_z$ \vs inferred proportions $\hat{\rho}_z$ of respondents
reporting durations $d_i \in \mathbb{d}_z$ selling sex,
following each stage of adjustment from \sref{meth.yss}.
Figure~\ref{fig:yss.adj} illustrates
% LW: can we make it even clearer? i believe +censoring is ontop of +sampling;
%     and +interruption is on top of the sampling and censoring?
%     if so - make it clearer/explicit.
the estimated cumulative distributions for years selling sex following each stage of adjustment,
while Table~\ref{tab:yss.adj} provides the corresponding distribution means $\bar{D}$ and \ci.
In this case, the final estimate of 4.06~(2.29,~6.34) is similar to the original median of 4,
because each adjustment alternates betwen increasing and decreasing $\bar{D}$.
The censoring adjustment yields the largest increase, while
the interruption adjustment yields the largest decrease.

\subsection{Rates of Partnership Change}\label{res.parts}
Figure~\ref{fig:parts.fit} illustrates the distributions of
observed proportions $p_z$ \vs inferred proportions $\hat{\rho}_z$ of women
reporting $x_i \in \mathbb{x}_z$ partners in the past 30 days,
under the three partnership duration assumptions.
Figure~\ref{fig:parts.fsw} illustrates the inferred
rates of partnership change ($Q$) and numbers of current partners ($K$) under each assumption,
while Table~\ref{tab:parts.fsw} provides the corresponding means and \ci.
The biased estimates of $Q$ and $K$ appear equal because $Q$ is defined as per-month.
Biases are largest for
$Q$ with long partnerships (\eg non-paying partners) and
$K$ with short partnership (\eg new clients).
However, biases are significant for
both $Q$ and $K$ with ``medium-length'' partnerships (\eg regular clients).
Figure~\ref{fig:parts.grid} illustrates generalized trends in these biases.
